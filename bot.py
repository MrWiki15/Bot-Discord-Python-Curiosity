  'Did you know: A few years ago, one of the strangest events in the Bitcoin mining industry was recorded, which was reported by Jameson Lopp's Twitter account. Lopp published the data of a completely empty block of bitcoins, whose confirmation reward had not been claimed. That is, a miner had worked for free. The 12.5 BTC that corresponded to the miner for his operations in the network had not been claimed at the time of completion of the operation, for which reason they were irretrievably lost. A mistake that turned out to be very costly, given that 12.5 BTC today represents a total of more than 338 thousand dollars.
